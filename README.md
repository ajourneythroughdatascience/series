## About
Here you will find a list of all my projects & collaborations. Projects are ordered descending by publish date. The start date & end date refer to the actual project design & execution.

Keep in mind that this section refers to my personal portfolio; thus projects included are not explained step-by-step. If you’d like to build your own project using guidance, you can head to the [guided-projects](https://github.com/pabloagn/guided-projects) repo.
